# Tek-a-L8r Cybersecurity Project Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio**! This repository serves as a platform for showcasing my projects, documenting my learning journey, and exploring various technologies within the realm of cybersecurity. As a network security professional and aspiring cybersecurity analyst with over 10 years of experience, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skill set.

This portfolio will evolve over time, and I invite you to follow along as I explore different areas of cybersecurity.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this portfolio is to:
- **Showcase Projects**: Display practical applications of cybersecurity concepts, especially in scripting, automation, and network setups.
- **Track Learning**: Maintain a record of my learning progress, highlight certifications, and document the knowledge and tools I acquire along the way.

This repository will reflect my journey toward deeper expertise in cybersecurity, with a special focus on scripting, network security, threat detection, and other real-world applications.

## What to Expect

As this portfolio develops, you can expect:

- **Python Scripts**: Initial projects will focus on scripting, such as automation for security tasks, vulnerability scanning, and log analysis.
- **Network Lab Creation**: I'll document the creation of both cloud-based and physical gear setups for a network lab, demonstrating skills in designing, configuring, and securing networks. This will include both home labs and cloud-based environments for practical testing and experimentation.
- **Cybersecurity Tools Setup**: Projects that demonstrate the installation and configuration of essential cybersecurity tools such as:
  - **SIEM (e.g., Splunk)**: Setting up local instances of tools like Splunk for log parsing and creating visualizations from scratch.
  - **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: Deploying and configuring EDR solutions for threat monitoring.
  - **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**: Implementing automation frameworks to streamline security operations.
  - Other tools like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and vulnerability management platforms.
- **Certifications Progress**: Updates on certifications as I progress toward achieving:
  - Python Institute certifications
  - TryHackMe badges and certificates
  - Palo Alto Firewall certifications
  - Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
  - Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
  - Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)

I will regularly update the portfolio with new tools, technologies, and techniques as I explore different areas in the cybersecurity domain.

## Roadmap & Project Highlights

### Current Projects:
- **Scripting Automation**: Creating Python scripts to automate various cybersecurity tasks.
- **Network Lab Creation**: Documenting the setup of cloud-based and physical network labs for security experiments and learning.
- **SIEM Setup**: Building a local Splunk instance, configuring it to parse logs, and creating visualizations.

### Future Projects:
- Vulnerability assessment and management tools
- Firewall configuration automation (Palo Alto)
- Threat detection with Python and SIEM tools
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing simulations

## How to Use This Portfolio

Feel free to explore the projects, clone the repository, and test out any of the code. Each project will include instructions and documentation for running the scripts, prerequisites, and any relevant context.

As I gain more experience and certifications, I will be adding more in-depth projects with detailed write-ups and resources. If you have feedback or suggestions, I encourage you to reach out.

## Contribution and Feedback

I value collaboration and feedback from the cybersecurity community. If you have ideas for improvement or wish to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
